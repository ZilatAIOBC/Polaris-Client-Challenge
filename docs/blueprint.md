# **App Name**: Polaris Queue Uploader

## Core Features:

- Drag and Drop Upload: Accept multiple files via drag and drop.
- File Queuing: Visually queue the files for upload.
- Concurrent Uploads: Upload a maximum of 3 files simultaneously.
- Automatic Retries: Retry failed uploads automatically.
- Display Uploaded Files: Visually display the list of uploaded files, so they can be viewed or managed. Use Polaris components to ensure seamless integration with the rest of the UI.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Shopify's signature Teal (#54B4C2) to align with the Polaris design system.
- Background color: Light gray (#FAFAFA) for a clean and professional look.
- Accent color: Subtle purple (#635BFF) to highlight interactive elements without clashing with the primary Teal.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and easily readable interface. Using 'Inter' ensures consistency with Polaris's design principles.
- Use clear and consistent icons from the Polaris icon library, maintaining a consistent style with Shopify's design language.
- Adhere to Polaris's grid system to maintain consistent spacing and alignment across the file uploader.
- Subtle loading animations using the Shopify/Polaris loading component when files are uploading. Indicate uploads that failed using error alerts.
